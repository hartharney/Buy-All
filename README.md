## 1. Introduction

This microservice application is designed to showcase a simplified version of a microservices architecture using Express for building RESTful APIs, Node.js for server-side scripting, and PostgreSQL as the database management system. The application demonstrates how different microservices can interact to collectively form a larger application.

## 2. Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete user accounts.
- **Product Service**: Manage product listings and details.
- **Order Processing**: Allow users to place orders and track order status.
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints using token-based authentication.
- **Payment Processing**: Simulate payment transactions.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## 4. Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hartharney/Buy-All-.git
   cd microservice-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database.

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Your microservice application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 5. Project Structure

The project structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and is organized as follows:

- `/src`: Contains the application source code.
  - `/controllers`: Controllers for each microservice.
  - `/models`: Database models.
  - `/routes`: API routes.
  - `/services`: Business logic and services.
- `/config`: Configuration files.
- `/test`: Unit and integration tests.

## 6. Configuration

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the necessary environment variables for your application, including database connection details, secret keys, and API keys.

## 7. Usage

- Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for information on available endpoints and how to interact with the microservices.
